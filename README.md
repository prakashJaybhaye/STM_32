Done

Learn How to Read Data Sheet & Refrance manual of STM32 uC
Learn about Registers used to set GPIOs
Learn about AHB1,RCC,GPIOxODR,GPIOxIDR,GPIOxBSRR
How to access base address and how to jump to perfiferal address by offset value 
Learn How to right register level code for STM32 and made Led Blinking Code for STM 32 without ussing extra library or HAL 
Made own LEd Toggle API to Toggle LED form Sratch without ussing extra library or HAL by just by this api LED_ToGGle(PIN_Number) able to Toogle any GPIo pin 
Learn about How GPIO IDR work and made code to Toogle led on button press and on led contunue while button is pressed
Lerned about Cortex M4 SysTimer register and designed delay function Bare metal
Implemnted code for Led Blinking using accurate Delay 

Goal 
1. Learn to write True Baremetal Code for STM32uC
2. ADCs DACs Timer all perfiferals of uC
3. Learn form Led Blinking to all Important Communication protocols
4. Learn RTOS


Challenge taken 
Not Use of Any external prewritten or HAL library. learn Basic -> write own library -> use in projects
